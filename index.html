    The Math Team is responsible for all the necessary calculations for the 7-day trip to Greece. We are in charge of collecting and organizing all the expenses to create a complete and accurate budget. This includes the total cost of the vacation, covering transportation, accommodation, food, activities, visa fees, and estimated travel time. Our goal is to ensure that everything is financially planned so the trip runs smoothly and stays within budget.</p>

    The language group wrote a script about six girls who take yearly trips together. This year, they were inspired to visit Greece after seeing a video in an electronics store. They thoroughly researched the trip, including budget, duration, Greek history, and common chronic illnesses. To prepare for communication, they considered the language needs of two girls who only understood English but spoke French and Arabic. The group explored whether those languages were spoken in Greece to help ensure smooth communication during their travels.</p>
